
Mixed Reality Simulation Platform (MIXR)
========================================

If you have stumbled across this repo, I strongly recommend you vists the source repo at
https://github.com/doughodson/mixr. I am a Modeling and Simulation Engineer by trade, a 
Computer Engineer by degree, and a Sodtware Engineer by force (I am forced to make software 
do what I want). Having said that, this repo falls under the same open source license 
as the source repo.

The current objective of this fork, is to get everything building on a Windows with VS 2022, including 3rd party dependencies.
